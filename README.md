# SailorInfo
Description:
Create a table called Sailor within a database called EmployeeDB. You should use the network Java DB mode (running on localhost) to implement this database
The Sailor table looks like this: (only a few selected rows are shown below)
Lastname,Firstname,Position,Salary
Ann,Emma,Engineer,51494
Minerva,Camille,Captain,79673

Allow the user to print 3 reports: 
1. A list of top-earning sailors in each Position. 
2.	The sailors earning the least, highest and above average salaries.
3.	A list of Sailors whose Lastname starts with ‘R’ and earn more than $58543.
